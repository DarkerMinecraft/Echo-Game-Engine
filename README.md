#Echo Game Engine

I followed The Cherno Game Engine Series for a while and some of the code is still begin used for from his tutorials such as the Events. I am working on something else that includes Vulkan and DirectX so this is my experiment project. 

#Building 
I recommend Visual Studio and running the Win-GenerateProjects.bat file. My current setup is with VS22 but please changed it depending of your Visual Studios. Afterwards just open the new Echo.sln file and build.
